This set of perl scripts, images and sql files allows one to locate the building extracted from the PDF on an image. 

- the sql file was generated by the perl script from the pdf file. 
- the image was generated using my PDF-JRasterizer.

Caveats : 
- the extractor script only work for the 'Prevessin' pdf.
- please don't press 'enter' on the webpage, click 'locate'.
- no CSS yet.
- it is really ugly.

Used perl modules : 
CAM::PDF  
DBD::SQLite  
DBI  
CGI
