This set of perl scripts, images and PDF files allows one to locate the buildings on the Meyrin and Prevessin sites. The building location location is extracted from the PDF. When you look for a particular building, its location (if known) is shown on an image of the corresponding site.

- the db file is generated by the 'coordinateExtractor.pl' script.
- there is a live demo on [niconomicon.net][demo].

Caveats :
- the extractor script works for both the 'Prevessin' and 'Meyrin' pdf.
- still ugly.

Bugs : 
- The space at the beginning of some words is not removed (this screws the sorting order). 
- the "200 metres" word is not properly extracted for Prevessin.

Used perl modules :  
CAM::PDF  
DBD::SQLite  
DBI
